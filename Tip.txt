If you're having trouble passing your dedicated GPU to WLS, type this into Ubuntu Terminal:

export GALLIUM_DRIVER=d3d12
export MESA_D3D12_DEFAULT_ADAPTER_NAME="Radeon RX 6900"
glxinfo -B



To make it permanent, add this to the bottom of "~/.bashrc"

# WSLg GPU selection (keeps you off llvmpipe)
export GALLIUM_DRIVER=d3d12
export MESA_D3D12_DEFAULT_ADAPTER_NAME="Radeon RX 6900 XT"
source "/home/sebgra518/DroneDockingSim/ardupilot/Tools/completion/completion.bash"
